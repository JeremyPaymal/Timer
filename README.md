# Timer
##  Demo: https://bubble-timer.netlify.app

## Description:
<hr>
This Website is a classic Timer Web App.

For this app, I used:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

## Why create this app ?
<hr>
As a new and novice front end web developer, I practice my skills everyday.
I'm actually working on my skills with Javascript so it was a good way to do it.
I add a bubble effect with CSS too. 
<br>
<br>

## What kind of improvement can you add ?
<hr>
- make it more responsive small devices<br>
- there 's a sidebar menu, but she's not effective for now. I 'd like to make it effective even if there's no real menu. I will juste leave the social media button.
